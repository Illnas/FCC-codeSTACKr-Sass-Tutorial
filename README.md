FCC Sass Tutorial by codeSTACKr (youtube tutorial)

So, I did say I will learn Sass and here I am. First I finished Sass tutorial on FCC (freeCodeCamp) website, 
was around 7 lessons, and by now I should have known, but I actually did think that this Sass is going to be easier
than Bootstrap, after all, it has few lessons. Oh boy, did I make a mistake -.-

First of all, it is easier and more familiar to use, I don't know whether that is because I am more familiar
with JS, or because I missed plain CSS. Secondly, this tutorial has shown me how much I am lagging behind professionals.
Well, you might argue and say "But, Nada, you are not employed nor did work in proffessional environment", to which
I would respond that that is not an excuse! Let's do checklist of all things I need to improve on basic CSS: grids (I
avoid using them), positions (same situation as with grids), hamburger menu (totally forgot about it), transform (did start
learning more about it). Thirdly, you might be wondering why I am even uploading this tutorial project. 
Simple, I want to be able to review it. And I did lose all the other tutorial files last time I was re-installing Windows,
so yeah....

Really liked this tutorial, and although I realised I have to go in-depth with some things, 
I also gave myself some kind of goal. 

Let's do some progress ;)
